## Project State
Functionnal : you can generate a password of desired length from a .exe file and choose with check boxes what characters the password has.
# Project Motivation
- I know there exist reliable and secure software that generates and store securately passwords, I would recommend to check : https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy and Dashlane or Bitwarden for your personnal use.
- However, I like creating applications with UI and I want to improve at it. So I need no more reasons not to try to make (some) things myself ðŸ¤  ! 
## Project Goals
1. Create a basic .exe app to generate random passwords of desired length. âœ…
2. Add settings property such as choosing if the password has numbers, uppercase, lowercase, special characters. âœ…
3. Added some testing with pytest / tox and automatic testing with github actions. âœ…


## Project Result
Currently (v2) we can generate a 'customized' password. We can choose its length and some of the characters that it posess (lower, uppercase, numbers, special characters).
It was exactly what I wanted.
This is the current result of this project :

Note : last updated version is not in the .exe file but they have no differences in terms of functionnality, the code has just been 'refactored' using a class.
