## Project State
Far from finished but it is functionnal : you can generate a password of desired length from a .exe file.
I want to learn making desktop application as well as web dev but I will prioritize the latest so this project may stay paused like that for some time. 
# Project Motivation
- I know there exist reliable and secure software that generates and store securately passwords, I would recommend to check : https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy and Dashlane or Bitwarden for your personnal use.
- However, I like creating applications with UI and I want to improve at it. So I need no more reasons not to try to make (some) things myself ðŸ¤  ! 
## Project Goals
1. Create a basic .exe app to generate random passwords of desired length âœ…
2. Add settings property such as choosing if the password has numbers, uppercase, lowercase, special characters.
