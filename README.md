# Project Motivation
- For reliable and secure software that generates and store securately passwords, I would recommand to check : https://github.com/Lissy93/awesome-privacy .
- However, I like creating applications with UI and I want to improve at it. So I need no more reasons not to try to make things myself ðŸ¤  !
## Project Goals
1. Create a basic .exe app to generate random passwords of desired length âœ…
2. Add settings property such as choosing if the password has numbers, uppercase, lowercase, special characters.
